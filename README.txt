This project is developed on Python 3.8.6

Running Updated Wavefront Algorithm:

    python3 wavefront.py

        This will save the path in a txt file called IFS.txt and plot the optimal path for the selected workspace.

    python3 pathsmmothning.py

        This will plot the smooth curve which is the final.

Running Benchmarking for Updated Wavefront Algorithm:

    python3 wavefrontbench.py

        This will plt the boxplots for path length and computation time for all the three workspaces.

Running Benchmarking for RRT with shooting method:

    python3 RRT_shooting_benchmark.py

        This will plt the boxplots for path length and computation time for all the three workspaces.
